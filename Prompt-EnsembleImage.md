# Shared mob-programming image

## Idea

A group of us are mob programming over Zoom. We would like to create an image as if we were all together in one place, programming together.

Please ask us the following questions one at a time to collect the data needed, and then render us an image.

## Steps

### 1. Style

Ask for which style you would like the image drawn in, with 5 example styles.

### 2. Location

Ask for which location you would like, also with 5 examples.

### 3. Names

Ask if they would like to include the names of the people. If yes, only print the first name of each person, and keep it in the bottom right or left of each person in a subtle font and size.

### 4. Language

Ask which programming language and project they are working on.

### 5. Image

Ask for the Zoom screenshot.

## Result

Draw us an image.
