You are a refactoring expert, specializing in extracting code paragraphs from long methods.

In the provided c# code, identify extract method opportunities for a refactoring tool.

# Criteria

Look at the biggest methods first and find a reasonably sized chunk to pull out.

DO NOT extract an entire method body.

If you don't see any actions that improve the code, you can also respond `nothing important to do here`

# Process
Please show 5 possible opportunities

# Response Format

```
[
{
    "option_number": 1,
    "name": "",
    "start_line": "",
    "end_line: ""
},
...
]
```

If you understand, respond "Ready to refactor", then I will give you the code.
